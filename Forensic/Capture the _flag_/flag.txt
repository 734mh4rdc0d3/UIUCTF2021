the challenge name suggests to capture the :flag:.
an emoji is written in discord with colon surrounding it, which we know from the emote challenege.

i went to discord channel and got the flag emoji with :flag: and saved it.
exiftool on the image shows that we have to get LSB(least significant bit) of the pixels.
(text description: LSBs(Pixels[1337:]))

There are two catches here though. The pixels are RGBA format where A is the opacity and we have to reject it.
Also the pixels are to be taken from 1337 position in Coloumn major order rather than the classical Row major order.

Consider the RGB values in a flat array from the position 1337 in Row major order and convert the parts of 8 least significant bits to characters with ASCII coding and get the flag. the script flag.py gives the flag.
Apologies for messy code.
