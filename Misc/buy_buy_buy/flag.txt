This is auction bot! Auction bot is dedicated to provide the best auctioning experience possible.

    To become a member of the Auction House please run the command /initiate.
    There are a variety of commands you can run (type / to see a list).
    You can buy and sell items from the market places. Each item has a specific type.

    - single: Price for item is static no matter how many you sell.
    - collectable: If you sell these at the same time an arbitrary multiplier increases overall value
    - part: Get an item that can be assembled into a larger single set!
    - set: An item worth more than all the parts combined. Type /assemble <Set Name> to convert parts to set

    There is a public auction happening with payouts and new items happening every 10 minutes.
    You check which items are being auctioned with /public_auction_items.

    /bid to bid in the public auction btw.

    These items are all being auctioned at the same time so feel free to bid for any item being auctioned you fancy.

    You can also host your own private auctions! Simply run /create to make a private room and share that code with
    anyone you want! Your private room is permanent so share your room code wisely! However, members of your room
    can leave with /leave_room. Steps are:

    1) /start_private_auction
    2) /auction <item> <starting bid>
    3) /stop_private_bidding (this determines who one the bid and distributes the payout)
    4) /end_private_auction

    If you royally screw up you can do /i-screwed-up

    Good Luck!
