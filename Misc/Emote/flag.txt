request ian5v for emote image and get an emoji :emote: as a reply.
save the emoji image and get 16X16 black and white image.

convert the image to matrix and each row now has two alphabetic characters in row major order.

example first row:
[False  True  True  True False  True False  True] [False  True  True False  True False False  True]
convert to binary for row one.
01110101, 01101001,
convert to ascii.

find the script in flag.py.
